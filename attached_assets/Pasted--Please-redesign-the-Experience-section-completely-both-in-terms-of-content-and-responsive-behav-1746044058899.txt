ðŸŽ¯ Please redesign the Experience section completely, both in terms of content and responsive behavior, especially when switching to Arabic (RTL).

ðŸ”§ Issues:

The content is inaccurate and doesnâ€™t reflect my real work experience.

The responsive layout breaks badly in Arabic view â€“ alignments, text wrapping, and layout all get distorted.

âœ… What to do:

Replace the entire content with the real professional experiences listed below.

Ensure RTL compatibility: use proper flex, grid, or logical CSS (margin-inline, padding-inline, etc.) to support both English and Arabic.

Maintain a clean, professional visual hierarchy with dates, company names, role titles, and bullet points.

Make sure it works perfectly on both desktop and mobile views.
